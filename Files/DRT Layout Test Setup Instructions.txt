Dump Render Tree Layout Test Setup with BSQUARE Browser
Chris Yang
Last Update: Jan 21st 2013
Please note: This is for Win32 installation

Note 1 (Date: Jan 9th 2013)
The following instruction works successfully in the current Win7 32-bit desktop/laptop
with VS2005 or 2008 installed.


1. If you do not have VS2008 with SP1, please install them.
Location: \\btaiwanfs\PES\DevTools\VS2008 professional
Note: You need a Disc Burner software to execute the Disc Image File.
      You can try UltraISO (Google it)
Note2: Copy the entire disk files/directories to a newly created file
       called VS2008 and run setup.exe
Note3: For Service Pack 1, run SPInstaller application
Note4: For VS2005, you need to install the CE6 R3 Platform Builder
and all of the subsequent updates for Platform Builder under
\\btaiwanfs\PES\Jetstream\Yamazaki(CE6) directory


2. (maybe optional) If you do not have GIT, please install it.
Location: http://git-scm.com/ (Latest stable release)
Note: Please select "Use Git Bash only" for Adjusting your PATH environment
      and "Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings" for Configuring
      the line ending conversions


3. Install CE/MS Device Emulator
Location: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5352
          or Google "Microsoft Device Emulator 3.0"
Note: You might see "Repair" and "Uninstall" dialog box the first time when
      you try to run the setup. Please select "Uninstall" first and run the
      setup again.


4. (maybe optional) Install MS Virtual PC 2007 (if it doesn't exist on your PC)
Location: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4580
          or Google "Microsoft Virtual PC 2007"


5. Install CE6_Default.msi which is the SDK for CE6

An MSI for installing CE6_Default can be found at:
 
\\newcastle\PESBuild\Builds\drop\WEBKIT\SDKs\CE6_Default.msi

Note: if you are installing CE6_Default.msi on Visual Studio 2008, you need
to select Custom Installation and Deselect Documentation from the installation
or else you¡¦ll get the following errors during installation:
 
"ToolMsmCA (Error): IHxRegisterSession transaction failure: Err = 0x8004036f, pRegSession -> CommitTransaction()" or 
"ToolsMsmCA (Error):IHxFilters filter registration failure: Err=0x80040305, Context = pFilters ->SetNamespace(Namespace)"
 
This will not happen if you¡¦re on Visual Studio 2005 (but then it's a pain
to install VS2005 since you also would need to install CE6 R3 Platform Builder
and all of the subsequent updates for PB).


6. Get the latest Bsquare browser build in
\\newcastle\PESBuild\Builds\drop\WEBKIT_V2\v2-bsquare directory and copy it
(i.e. 14-2012-12-27_15-25-03) in your local disk (e.g. C:\bsqBrowser)


7. (Bringing up CE6 Emulator)
 a. Start VS2008 (or 2005)
 b. Select Tools->"Connect to Device" menu and a "Connect to Device" dialog box will appar
 c. Select CE6_Default under Platform: and choose "CE6_Default Emulator" and press the "Connect" button

Win Embedded CE6 Emulator will appear.


8. From the Device Emulator, perform the following:
 a. File->Configure, Network tab, check "Enable NE2000 PCMCIA..." and select the
    NIC or wireless card, press OK button
 b. File->Configure, General tab, under Shared folder, enter the folder containing
    the latest Bsquare browser build (i.e. 14-2012-12-27_15-25-03)


9. Trigger bsqBrowser
 a. Double click on My Device/Storage Card
 b. Double click on bsqBrowser
 c. You should now be able to browser the web


10. To get DumpRenderTree.exe working, you would need tux.exe and kato.dll which
are currently missing in the Bsquare browser build directory.

Please get the RAR file containing those 2 files under:
\\btaiwanfs\PES\QA\Tools\Emulator\CE6\Tux-ARMv4i

and put both tux.exe and kato.dll under Bsquare browser build directory
(i.e. 14-2012-12-27_15-25-03)


11. Follow the instructions under Wiki for DRT:
http://wiki/index.php?title=Dump_Render_Tree

For both Demo1.html and launchDemo01.txt, I have saved them under:
\\btaiwanfs\PES\QA\Tools\Emulator\CE6\Tux-ARMv4i

Both Demo1.html and launchDemo01.txt are just sample files for you to look
at how DumpRenderTree.exe works.

You can first try to run DumpRenderTree.exe and see the result for yourself:
1. From the CE6 Emulator, Start->Run cmd.exe
2. From cmd window, type "cd storage card"
3. Type "dumprendertree --input-file "\storage card\launchDemo01.txt"

Note: You need to enter full path for launchDemo01.txt file or else dumprendertree.exe
will fail.

Here's the output for dumprendertree.exe execution (note: you should see
didFailProvisionalLoadWithError which is fine, according to Wiki):

#URL:\storage card\demo01.html 

main frame - didFailProvisionalLoadWithError
layer at (0,0) size 800x600
  RenderView at (0,0) size 800x600
layer at (0,0) size 800x600
  RenderBlock {HTML} at (0,0) size 800x600
    RenderBody {BODY} at (8,8) size 784x584
#EOF
#EOF

Note2: DRT is similar to a browser such that it is actually a shell of WebKit.
WebKit itself is a web rendering engine and DRT, similar to a browser, is a shell
that would render the web content in either text or image form.


12. To run DumpRenderTree.exe in a script fashion, you would need TUX4DRT.
Here is the step on running tux4drt:
 a. Use DefaultScript.txt under the command line:
	tux.exe ¡Vd ¡§\storage card\tux4drt.dll¡¨ ¡Vf ¡§\storage card\log.txt¡¨
    Note: place the html and expected files under the respective directory
    specified in DefaultScript.txt
 b. Tux will use defaultscript.txt's HTML files as input test case files
    to render inputs (i.e. CSS/CSS3 styles, HTML tags, etc) within the HTML
    body (i.e. <body><p class="test"></p></body) and, via Javascript
    functions (i.e. document.getElementById or documentgetElementByClassName) and
    depending on whether the test input is CSS style or HTML tags, compare the
    rendering output to see if WebKit is successful in rendering CSS style or
    HTML tags correctly.

I have placed a few HTML files as test case files as well as DefaultScript.txt
file under \\btaiwanfs\PES\QA\Tools\Emulator\CE6\Tux-ARMv4i for you to try out.

You may ask: what does DRT test?

Well, DRT basically test WebKit rendering. If you take a look at the sample
HTML file (say css-black.html), you'll notice that the input test value is the
color 'black'. WebKit should render the value 'back' as rgb(0, 0, 0). If not,
then there's a bug in WebKit.

One final note: you'll notice that when you execute tux.exe, there is a newly
created file folder with the name formatted as "<date>-<hour-min-sec>". This
is quite normal as tux.exe is creating a temporary folder to store its DRT
related test files.





Note 2 (Date: Jan 9th 2013)
The following instruction was compiled based on Jeffery's past instructions
as well as various instructions taken from various QA team members. However,
the emulator fails to recognize the desktop/laptop NIC.

1. If you do not have VS2008 with SP1, please install them.
Location: \\btaiwanfs\PES\DevTools\VS2008 professional
Note: You need a Disc Burner software to execute the Disc Image File.
      You can try UltraISO (Google it)
Note2: Copy the entire disk files/directories to a newly created file
       called VS2008 and run setup.exe
Note3: For Service Pack 1, run SPInstaller application
Note4: For VS2005, you need to install the CE6 R3 Platform Builder
and all of the subsequent updates for Platform Builder under
\\btaiwanfs\PES\Jetstream\Yamazaki(CE6) directory

2. If you do not have GIT, please install it.
Location: http://git-scm.com/ (Latest stable release)
Note: Please select "Use Git Bash only" for Adjusting your PATH environment
      and "Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings" for Configuring
	  the line ending conversions

3. Install CE/MS Device Emulator
Location: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5352
          or Google "Microsoft Device Emulator 3.0"
Note: You might see "Repair" and "Uninstall" dialog box the first time when
      you try to run the setup. Please select "Uninstall" first and run the
	  setup again.

4. Install MS Virtual PC 2007 (if it doesn't exist on your PC)
Location: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4580
          or Google "Microsoft Virtual PC 2007"

5. Follow the instructions located in BSQUARE TW forum location under:
http://rdtw.camelot.bsquare.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=510&extra=page%3D1
Here are some of the important items from that forum discussion:
  a. NK.bin located in \\btaiwanfs\bshare\Depts\PES\QA\Tools\Emulator\CE6\JeffreyCh
     should be copied to a file (let's call it C:\Emulator\CE6)
  b. Enter command "DeviceEmulator.exe /memsize 128 C:\Emulator\CE6\NK.bin /video
     640x480x16"
     Note: /memsize can be 256 and /video can be 800x600x16
  c. Run 'dmacnect' in Emulator
  d. Note: Step 7, Enable DMA connection in ActiveSync is probably not needed

6. From the Device Emulator, perform the following:
 a. File->Configure, Network tab, check "Enable NE2000 PCMCIA..." and select the
    NIC or wireless card, press OK button
 b. Press OK on the pop-up dialog box
 c. File->Configure, General tab, under Shared folder, enter the folder containing
    the latest Bsquare browser build (i.e. 14-2012-12-27_15-25-03)

7. Trigger bsqBrowser
 a. Double click on My Device/Storage Card
 b. Double click on bsqBrowser
 <currently has error on desktop as the emulator doesn't recognize the NIC>
