<p>In the example below, usernames are shown along with the number of
points in a contest.
If the bdi element is not supported in the browser, the username of the
Arabic user would confuse the text (the bidirectional algorithm would
put the colon and the number "90" next to the word "User" rather than
next to the word "points").
</p>


<ul>

 <li>User <bdi>hrefs</bdi>: 60 points</li>
 <li>User <bdi>jdoe</bdi>: 80 points</li>
 <li>User <bdi>&#1573;&#1610;&#1575;&#1606;</bdi>: 90 points</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Note:</b> The &lt;bdi&gt; tag is currently supported only in Firefox and Chrome.</p>
