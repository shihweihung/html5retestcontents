Here comes a long quotation:
<blockquote>
This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation.
</blockquote>
Notice that a browser inserts white space before and after a blockquote element. It also inserts margins for the blockquote element.

<p>
To break<br />lines<br />in a<br />paragraph,<br />use the br element.
